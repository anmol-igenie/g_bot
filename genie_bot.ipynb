    "- **For Textual or Semi-Structured Data**: If the table contains mixed-format data or text fields (e.g., comments, descriptions), and the question involves broad or interpretive insights, choose the `RAG Pipeline`.\n",
    "- **For Numerical Data**: If the question involves direct operations on numerical data (e.g., sums, averages, comparisons), choose the `DATAFRAME Pipeline`.\n",
    "- **For Mixed Questions**: When both text and numerical elements are involved, select the pipeline that aligns best with the core requirement of the question (e.g., is the focus more on numeric calculations or text-based insights?).\n",

Only choose the `RAG Pipeline` if the core of the question clearly requires textual analysis.\n",
    "- **Limit `RAG Pipeline`** to situations where structured numerical analysis cannot solve the problem, such as when dealing with broad natural language queries or complex text-based analysis.\n",
